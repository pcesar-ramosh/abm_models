**Author:** Cesar Ramos  
**Purpose:** Repository prepared for an academic purpose.  
**Scope:** Educational and research-oriented implementations of Agent-Based Models (ABM) applied to economics and finance.

## Overview

Agent-Based Models (ABM) are computational frameworks that simulate the interactions of heterogeneous agents (e.g., households, firms, banks, traders) to study how macro-level patterns emerge from micro-level behavior. In economics and finance, ABMs are especially useful when:

- agents are heterogeneous and boundedly rational,
- interactions are network-based (credit, trade, information),
- dynamics are non-linear and out-of-equilibrium,
- stylized facts (fat tails, volatility clustering) must be reproduced.

This repository consolidates models, experiments, and documentation to support transparent, reproducible, and interpretable ABM research.

## Research Objectives

1. **Modeling economic complexity:** emergence, feedback loops, and non-linear dynamics.  
2. **Financial market microstructure:** order flow, price formation, and market impact.  
3. **Systemic risk & contagion:** interconnected balance sheets, networks, and cascades.  
4. **Policy experiments:** stress testing, regulatory scenarios, and macroprudential tools.
