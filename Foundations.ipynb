    "# Agent-Based Models (ABM) in Economics — Theory, Assumptions, Math, Computation, and Resources \n",
    "\n",
    "## 0) One-sentence definition\n",
    "**Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)** is a computational approach that represents an economy as a **dynamic system of interacting heterogeneous agents** (households, firms, banks, government, central bank) whose **local rules + interaction structure** generate **aggregate (macro) outcomes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Core concepts and definitions (glossary)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Agents\n",
    "An **agent** is an entity with:\n",
    "- **State variables** (e.g., wealth, employment status, prices, inventories, FX holdings),\n",
    "- **Decision rules** (heuristics, optimization, learning),\n",
    "- **Interaction protocols** (trade, credit, labor matching, networks),\n",
    "- **Constraints** (budget, borrowing limits, institutional rules).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Micro-state, macro-state, and emergence\n",
    "- **Micro-state** at time $t$: the full configuration $X_t = \\{x_{i,t}\\}_{i=1}^N$.\n",
    "- **Macro-state**: aggregates $M_t = g(X_t)$ (GDP, inflation, unemployment, FX premium).\n",
    "- **Emergence**: macro regularities appear from micro interactions without being imposed as equilibrium conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Time, events, and scheduling\n",
    "- **Time-stepped ABM**: updates occur on a grid $t = 0,1,2,\\dots$.\n",
    "- **Event-driven ABM**: events occur at random or scheduled times; the simulator maintains an event queue.\n",
    "- **Scheduling** matters because update order can change results (especially with credit rationing, matching, and inventory dynamics).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Heterogeneity\n",
    "Agents differ in parameters or states: productivity, risk aversion, access to credit/FX, informality, expectations, income sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Networks and markets\n",
    "Interactions can be:\n",
    "- **Random matching**,\n",
    "- **Fixed networks** (input-output links, credit network, labor network),\n",
    "- **Endogenous networks** (links formed by profitability, trust, geography).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 “ACE” terminology\n",
    "In economics, ABM is often framed as **Agent-Based Computational Economics (ACE)**: economic processes as open-ended, evolving systems of interacting agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Why ABM in macro and policy (compared to DSGE/HANK)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Typical motivations\n",
    "ABMs are especially attractive when:\n",
    "- **Heterogeneity** is central (distributional effects, informality),\n",
    "- **Networks and frictions** dominate transmission (credit, supply chains),\n",
    "- **Out-of-equilibrium dynamics** matter (crises, rationing, regime switches),\n",
    "- **Institutions and rules** are discrete and operational (FX controls, quotas, segmented markets).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 ABM vs DSGE (conceptual contrast)\n",
    "- DSGE: equilibrium, representative/limited heterogeneity, optimization, linearization or perturbation.\n",
    "- ABM: explicit heterogeneity, bounded rationality allowed, disequilibrium, discontinuities, “rules-of-the-game” are explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 ABM vs HANK (complementarity)\n",
    "- HANK: microfounded dynamic programming + equilibrium; strong discipline but computationally heavy, harder for non-price rationing.\n",
    "- ABM: can represent rich institutional details and segmentation; discipline comes from **calibration/estimation + validation + robustness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) Brief history and canonical landmarks (economics/social science)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Early “generative” social science and segregation dynamics\n",
    "- Schelling-type segregation dynamics show how mild micro preferences can generate macro segregation patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Sugarscape and generative social science\n",
    "- A milestone is the “Sugarscape” tradition: simple rules, rich emergent macro patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 ABM in economics after 2008–2009\n",
    "- Renewed interest for policy relevance and financial crises: ABMs as complements for macro policy analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) A generic mathematical skeleton of an ABM\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Micro-state transition\n",
    "Let $X_t \\in \\mathcal{X}$ denote the full micro-state and $\\varepsilon_{t+1}$ all random innovations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General ABM law of motion**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_{t+1} = F(X_t, \\theta, \\varepsilon_{t+1}, z_t)\n",

    "\\Pr(X_{t+1}\\mid X_t, X_{t-1},\\dots) = \\Pr(X_{t+1}\\mid X_t)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Define $f_t(x)$ as the distribution of agent states (continuous or discrete). In many settings:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_{t+1} = \\mathcal{T}_\\theta(f_t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is rarely tractable in closed form; ABM uses simulation to approximate $\\mathcal{T}_\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Mean-field / representative interaction approximation (optional derivation tool)\n",
    "If interactions are “well-mixed”, an agent’s environment can be summarized by aggregates $M_t$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_{i,t+1} = f(x_{i,t}, M_t, \\varepsilon_{i,t+1})\n",

    "### 9.5 Acceleration options (Python ecosystem)\n",
